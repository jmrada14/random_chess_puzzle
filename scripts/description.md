# CSV to JSON:

This script converts a CSV file to a JSON file, I plan to make it more generic in the future.
for the moment it is design to convert the data from the
[Lichess Puzzle Database](https://database.lichess.org/#puzzles) from CSV to JSON.

Additionally, the data will be uploaded to a MongoDB database, so it can be used for
retrieving chess puzzles in a nice JSON format.
